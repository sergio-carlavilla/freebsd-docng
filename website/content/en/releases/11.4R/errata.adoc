[[intro]]
== Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD 11.4-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/, plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 11.4-STABLE also contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

[[open-issues]]
== Open Issues

* [2020-06-11] Source-based upgrades from FreeBSD 11.2 on the i386 architecture may fail to compile clang due to the amount of RAM consumed.
+
Adding `CFLAGS+=-O1` to `/etc/make.con+` or `/etc/src.conf` has been observed to work around the compile-time RAM exhaustion.
+
See https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=246274[PR 246274] for additional details.
* [2020-06-16] The FreeBSD 11.4 release notes erroneously state the KDE desktop environment has been updated to version 5.8.4.1.19.12.3. The correct version is 5.18.4.1.19.12.3.
