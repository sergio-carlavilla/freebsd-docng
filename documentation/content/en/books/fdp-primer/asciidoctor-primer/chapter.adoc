Most FDP documentation is written with AsciiDoc. This chapter explains what that means, how to read and understand the documentation source, and the techniques used. To get a complete reference of the AsciiDoctor capabilities please consult the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/home/[Asciidoctor documentation]. Some of the examples used in this chapter have been taken from the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference].

[[asciidoctor-primer-overview]]
== Overview

In the original days of computers, electronic text was simple. There were a few character sets like ASCII or EBCDIC, but that was about it. Text was text, and what you saw really was what you got. No frills, no formatting, no intelligence.

In the original days of computers, electronic text was simple. There were a few character sets like ASCII or EBCDIC, but that was about it. Text was text, and what you saw really was what you got. No frills, no formatting, no intelligence.

Inevitably, this was not enough. When text is in a machine-usable format, machines are expected to be able to use and manipulate it intelligently. Authors want to indicate that certain phrases should be emphasized, or added to a glossary, or made into hyperlinks. Filenames could be shown in a “typewriter” style font for viewing on screen, but as “italics” when printed, or any of a myriad of other options for presentation.

It was once hoped that Artificial Intelligence (AI) would make this easy. The computer would read the document and automatically identify key phrases, filenames, text that the reader should type in, examples, and more. Unfortunately, real life has not happened quite like that, and computers still require assistance before they can meaningfully process text.

More precisely, they need help identifying what is what. Consider this text:

To remove [.filename]#/tmp/foo#, use man:rm[1].

[source,bash]
----
% rm /tmp/foo
----

It is easy to see which parts are filenames, which are commands to be typed in, which parts are references to manual pages, and so on. But the computer processing the document cannot. For this we need markup.


The previous example is actually represented in this document like this:

....
To remove [.filename]#/tmp/foo#, use man:rm[1].

[source,bash]
----
% rm /tmp/foo
----
....

[[asciidoctor-headings]]
== Headings

AsciiDoctor support six headings levels. If the document type is `article` only one level 0 (`=`) can be used. If the document type is `book` can be multiple level 0 (`=`).

This is an example of headings in an `article`.

....
= Document Title (Level 0)

== Level 1 Section Title

=== Level 2 Section Title

==== Level 3 Section Title

===== Level 4 Section Title

====== Level 5 Section Title

== Another Level 1 Section Title
....

[WARNING]
====
Section levels cannot be skipped when nesting sections.

The following syntax is not correct.

....
= Document Title

== Level 2

==== Level 4
....
====

[[asciidoctor-paragraphs]]
== Paragraphs

Paragraphs don't require special markup in AsciiDoc. A paragraph is defined by one or more consecutive lines of text. To create a new paragraph leave one blank line.

For example, this is a heading with two paragraphs

....
= This is the heading

This is the firts paragraph.

And this is the second paragraph.
....

[[asciidoctor-lists]]
== Lists

AsciiDoctor support two type of lists ordered and unordered. To get more information about lists check link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/#lists[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference]

[[asciidoctor-ordered-lists]]
=== Ordered lists

To create an ordered list use the `*` character.

For example this is an ordered list.

....
* First item
* Second item
** Subsecond item
* Thrid item
....

And this would be rendered as.

* First item
* Second item
** Subsecond item
* Thrid item

[[asciidoctor-unordered-lists]]
=== Unordered lists

To create an unordered list use the `.` character.

For example this is an unordered lists.

....
. First item
. Second item
.. Subsecond item
. Thrid item
....

And this would be rendered as.

. First item
. Second item
.. Subsecond item
. Thrid item

[[asciidoctor-links]]
== Links

[[asciidoctor-links-external]]
=== External links

To point to another website the `link` macro should be used.

....
link:https://www.FreeBSD.org[FreeBSD]
....

[NOTE]
====
As the AsciiDoctor documentation points the `link` macro is not required when the target starts with a URL scheme like `https`. But is a good practice to ensure that AsciiDoctor renders correctly the link. Specially in non-latin languages like Japanese.
====

[[asciidoctor-links-internal]]
=== Internal link

To point to another book or article the AsciiDoctor variables should be used. For example, if we are in the `cups` article and we want to point to `ipsec-must` these steps should be used.

. Include the [.filename]#urls.adoc# file from [.filename]#~/doc/shared# folder.
+
....
\include::shared/{lang}/urls.adoc[]
....
+
. Then create a link using the AsciiDoctor variable to the `ipsec-must` article.
+
....
link:{ipsec-must}[IPSec-Must article]
....
+
And this would be rendered as.
+
link:{ipsec-must}[IPSec-Must article]

[[asciidoctor-conclusion]]
== Conclusion

That is the conclusion of this AsciiDoctor primer. For reasons of space and complexity, several things have not been covered in depth (or at all).
